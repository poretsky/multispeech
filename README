	Multispeech - Multilingual speech server

Multispeech was primarily designed as a multilingual speech server
for Emacspeak, but it can be useful in some other circumstances
as well, when multilingual speech feedback is needed.
For instance, it can serve as a backend module for Speech Dispatcher.
Multispeech produces audible speech, sounds and tone signals
according to the commands passed by client. It utilizes third party
speech synthesis software to perform actual TTS transformation.
See comments in the sample configuration file and corresponding
manual pages for further details.

Following additional libraries are necessary to compile the program:
Sndfile, PortAudio19 with C++ support, SoundTouch, Bobcat
and the Boost C++ library including following items:
libboost-thread, libboost-regex, libboost-filesystem,
libboost-iostreams and libboost-program-options.
See the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation instructions.
