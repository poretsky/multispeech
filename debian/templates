Type: select
Choices: ${choices}
Description: for internal use

 translation.

Template: shared/emacspeak/device
Type: select
Choices: ${choices}
_Description: Default speech server:
 The /etc/emacspeak.conf file will be configured so that the command
 '/usr/bin/emacspeak' will start Emacs with emacspeak support using
 this server.

 You may change the selection later by running
 'dpkg-reconfigure emacspeak' as root, or temporarily override the
 selection by setting the environment variable DTK_PROGRAM.
Default: DECtalk Express

# Translators, please do not translate "none"
_Description: Hardware port of the speech generation device:
 If a hardware device is used to generate speech, please enter the
 Unix device file associated with it, such as '/dev/ttyS0' or
 '/dev/ttyUSB0'.
 .
 If you use a software method to generate speech, please enter 'none'.
Default: none

Template: shared/emacspeak/invalidport
Type: error
_Description: ${port} is not a character special device

Template: shared/emacspeak/groupies
Type: string
_Description: Users of speech server:
 Users must be members of group ${group} to access the speech server
 connected to ${port}. Please review the space-separated list of
 current members of that group, and add or remove usernames if needed.
 .
 If you later add users to the system, you can either reconfigure
 the emacspeak package afterwards, or enroll the user in ${group}
 with 'adduser ${group} <user>'.
 .
 Group membership is checked at login time, so new members must log
 out and log in again before using the speech server.

Template: shared/emacspeak/invaliduser
Type: error
_Description: Invalid username ${user}
 There is no user named ${user}, so no such user could be added to
 ${group}.

Template: shared/emacspeak/rootgroup
Type: error
_Description: ${port} non-writable by unprivileged users
 Since the speech device is connected to ${port}, unprivileged users
 must have read/write access to that device.
 .
 You should modify the device permissions with 'chmod a+rw ${port}'
 or modify the device group with 'chown root:dialout ${port}',
 then reconfigure emacspeak with 'dpkg-reconfigure emacspeak'.
