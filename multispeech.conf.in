# This is a Multispeech configuration file template.
# Uncomment those entries which apply to your personal needs
# and system requirements.

# On startup Multispeech expects to find it's configuration
# in "<sysconfdir>/multispeech.conf" and "~/.multispeechrc".
# The user settings provided by "~/.multispeechrc"
# always take precedence over the system-wide ones
# from "<sysconfdir>/multispeech.conf". And all these settings in turn
# can be overridden by an extra configuration file specified via the
# command line. Some configuration options are mandatory, so at least
# one of these files must exist.

# The syntax is quite simple.

# Lines started from the "#" character are treated as comments.
# Blank lines are ignored. Each option entry looks like follows:
#
# keyword = value
#
# Case is significant.

# All options are logically grouped by sections.
# Each section is started by its name in square brackets
# on a separate line.


[frontend]
# The frontend options control interactions with client.
#
#charset = KOI8-R
# Input charset should be specified by its name. Available names
# can be found in "/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED" or wherever else
# it is on your system. By default this option is not set
# so current locale setting is used.
#
#native_voices = on
#dtk_voices = off
# These two options control inline parameters parsing.
# In the default state only native voices are enabled,
# so Multispeech behaves as it used to and accepts only
# special inline commands formed by Emacspeak. When dtk voices
# are enabled, Multispeech recognizes DECtalk inline commands and tries
# to emulate some subset of the DECtalk voice control capabilities.
# Use the word "yes" or "on" to enable and the word
# "no" or "off" to disable the option. Nothing prevents to keep
# both options enabled simultaneously. In this case DECtalk
# inline commands will be accepted as well as the native ones.
# If both options are disabled, then inline commands detection
# and parsing will not be performed at all.

[audio]
# This section contains general audio output control options.
#
#device = 
# Default device for all audio output (speech, sounds and tones).
# If it is not specified explicitly, then system default will be used.
# The DSP device specifications (such as "/dev/dsp")
# are allowed here as well as the ALSA ones.
#
#general_volume = 0.8
# This value is applied to the audio output in general.
# It should be in the range of (0.0..1.0]. Default value is 0.8.
#
#latency = 0.0
# Audio output latency in seconds. Default value 0.0 implies
# that reasonable latency will be chosen automatically.
# Normally this option should not be set up explicitly.
# Do it only if you are pretty unsatisfied by the automatic choice.

[sounds]
# Sound files playing control options.
#
#device = 
# Sound files playing device. This setting overwrites general default
# and allows to play sound files on a separate audio device.
# The DSP device specifications (such as "/dev/dsp")
# are accepted here as well as the ALSA ones.
#
#volume = 1.0
# Relative volume level for sound files playing. It is 1.0
# by default.
#
#asynchronous = yes
# This option enables or disables to play sound files
# simultaneously with other audio activities, such as
# speech and tone signals producing. It is enabled by default.
# Use the word "yes" or "on" to enable and the word
# "no" or "off" to disable.

[tones]
# This section is devoted to the tone signals producing
# control options.
#
#device = 
# Tones producing device. This setting overwrites general default
# and allows to use a separate device for tone signals.
# The DSP device specifications (such as "/dev/dsp")
# are accepted here as well as the ALSA ones.
#
#volume = 1.0
# Relative volume level for tone signals producing. It is 1.0
# by default.
#
#sampling = 44100
# Sampling frequency for generated tone signals. It is 44100
# by default.
#
#asynchronous = yes
# This option enables or disables to produce tone signals
# simultaneously with other audio activities, such as
# speech and sound files playing. It is enabled by default.
# Use the word "yes" or "on" to enable and the word
# "no" or "off" to disable.

[speech]
# General speech output control options.
#
#device = 
# Speech output device. This setting overwrites general default
# and allows to produce speech on a separate audio device.
# The DSP device specifications (such as "/dev/dsp")
# are accepted here as well as the ALSA ones.
#
#volume = 1.0
# Relative volume level for speech output. It is 1.0 by default.
#
#language = autodetect
# This option specifies default language. Allowed values are:
# "en" for English, "ru" for Russian or "autodetect" for automatic
# detection from the text nature. By default language is autodetected.

# Language related sections. These sections contain quite the same
# collection of options that affect speech on a specific language.
# Actual speech engine is chosen by the key option "engine".
# This option has no default. If it is not set then the language
# will not be available in Multispeech. It is not necessary to define
# speech engine for each language, but at least one must be defined.
# It is wise to define speech engine for only those languages
# that are actually to be used.

[en]
# English language related speech options.
#
engine = freephone
# English TTS engine. This option has no default. If it is not set
# then English speech output will be unavailable in Multispeech.
# The alternatives are as follows:
# freephone -- English speech with Freephone and Mbrola voice "en1";
# espeak -- English speech with Espeak TTS engine;
# espeak.mbrola -- English speech with Espeak and Mbrola voices;
# user -- user defined TTS engine.
#
#volume = 1.0
# English voice loudness relatively to the general speech volume
# level. It is 1.0 by default.
#
#pitch = 1.0
# English voice pitch adjustment relative to it's normal level.
# It is 1.0 by default. Greater value causes higher pitch.
#
#rate = 1.0
# Relative speech rate for English voice. It is 1.0 by default.
# Higher value causes quicker speech.
#
#acceleration = 0
# Apply additional speech tempo acceleration. Speech rate
# will be changed by specified difference in percents
# compared to the original tempo. Positive values cause
# speech acceleration while the negative ones actually imply
# slowing it down. Default value is 0 so no additional
# tempo change is applied.
#
#char_pitch = 1.0
#char_rate = 1.0
# Relative voice pitch and speech rate control applied to the single
# letters pronunciation. By default 1.0 is suggested.
#
#caps_factor = 1.2
# Voice pitch factor for capital letters. By default it is 1.2
# so capital letters are pronounced by slightly higher pitch.

[ru]
# Russian language related speech options.
#
engine = ru_tts
# Russian TTS engine. This option has no default. If it is not set
# then Russian speech output will be unavailable in Multispeech.
# The alternatives are as follows:

# espeak -- Russian speech with Espeak speech synthesizer;
# user -- User defined TTS engine.
#
#volume = 1.0
# Russian voice loudness relatively to the general speech volume
# level. It is 1.0 by default.

# Russian voice pitch adjustment relative to it's normal level.
# It is 1.0 by default. Greater value causes higher pitch.
#
#rate = 1.0
# Relative speech rate for Russian voice. It is 1.0 by default.
# Higher value causes quicker speech.
#
#acceleration = 0
# Apply additional speech tempo acceleration. Speech rate
# will be changed by specified difference in percents
# compared to the original tempo. Positive values cause
# speech acceleration while the negative ones actually imply
# slowing it down. Default value is 0 so no additional
# tempo change is applied.
#
#char_pitch = 1.0
#char_rate = 1.0
# Relative voice pitch and speech rate control applied to the single
# letters pronunciation. By default 1.0 is suggested.
#
#caps_factor = 1.2
# Voice pitch factor for capital letters. By default it is 1.2
# so capital letters are pronounced by slightly higher pitch.

# Speech backend sections. These sections contain some options
# allowing to control various aspects of interaction with the
# external programs utilized by Multispeech for TTS transformation.

[mbrola]
# Mbrola based backends specific options.
#
#executable = mbrola
# Path to the Mbrola executable. If only program name is specified
# (as it is by default) then environment variable "PATH"
# will be examined and all paths mentioned there will be searched.
#
#voices = <datadir>/mbrola-voices
# Path to the directory where Mbrola voice files are stored.
# By default "<datadir>/mbrola-voices" is suggested.

[freephone]
# Freephone backend specific options.
#
#executable = freephone
# Path to the Freephone executable. If only program name is specified
# (as it is by default) then environment variable "PATH"
# will be examined and all paths mentioned there will be searched.
#
#lexicon = <datadir>/freespeech/enlex.db
# Path to the lexical database. By default
# "<datadir>/freespeech/enlex.db" is suggested.

[ru_tts]
# Ru_tts backend specific options.

#lexicon = <datadir>/freespeech/rulex.db
# Path to the lexical database. By default
# "<datadir>/freespeech/rulex.db" is suggested.
#
#log = 
# Optional file to collect unknown words. This file must be writable
# for the Multispeech user. The collected data can be used later
# to improve lexical database. No such file is suggested by default
# so unknown words are not stored.

[espeak]
# Espeak based backends specific options.
#
#executable = espeak
# Path to the Espeak executable. If only program name is specified
# (as it is by default) then environment variable "PATH"
# will be examined and all paths mentioned there will be searched.

# Espeak voices for the supported languages.
#
#en = en
#ru = ru
# These are the default settings for English and Russian.
# Invoke "espeak --voices" to see all available alternatives.

[espeak.mbrola]
# Espeak+Mbrola multilingual speech backend control options.
# This section is devoted to assigning Mbrola voices
# to the supported languages. To see the list of the voices
# supported by Espeak try to invoke "espeak --voices".
# Only Mbrola voices are allowed here. Also make sure
# that you have corresponding Mbrola voices itself.
# See Espeak documentation for further details.
#
#en = en1
# English voice. By default en1 is used.

[user]
# User defined TTS backend options.
#
#command = 
# Shell command to perform TTS transformation. This command
# must accept text on the standard input and produce sound
# stream on the standard output. It should be a simple command,
# pipes or other shell complications are not allowed here,
# but command line arguments may be specified. Moreover, there are
# several special keywords recognized by Multispeech and replaced
# by actual values internally just before execution. This mechanism
# allows Multispeech to pass current speech parameters to the TTS
# engine. These keywords are as follows:
# %lang -- replaced by the language id string;
# %pitch -- replaced by relative voice pitch value;
# %rate -- replaced by relative speech rate value;
# %freq -- replaced by the sampling frequency value.
# The last keyword is replaced only when freq_control is enabled
# (see below).
#
#format = 
# Produced sound stream sample format. The following values
# are allowed here:
# s8 -- signed 8 bits;
# u8 -- unsigned 8 bits;
# s16 -- signed 16 bits.
# Leave this option commented out if sound stream is produced
# in a format that can be detected automatically, such as wave file
# for instance.
#
#sampling = 22050
# Produced sound stream sampling frequency in Hz. Assumed 22050
# by default. This option is ignored when sound stream format
# is autodetected.
#
#stereo = no
# Set to "yes" if produced sound stream is stereo. By default it is
# assumed mono. This option is ignored when sound stream format
# is autodetected.
#
#freq_control = no
# Set this option to "yes" if TTS engine accepts sampling frequency
# specification (as Mbrola does, for instance) and you wish
# to make use of this capability. This option allows "%freq"
# keyword replacement in command line. Leave commented out if unsure.
#
#charset = 
# Character set in which the TTS engine accepts  it's input.
# Available charset names can be found in "/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED"
# or wherever else it is on your system. By default this option
# is not set so current locale setting is used.
