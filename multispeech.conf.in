# This is a Multispeech configuration file template.
# Uncomment those entries which apply to your personal needs
# and system requirements.

# On startup Multispeech expects to find it's configuration
# in "<sysconfdir>/multispeech.conf" and "~/.multispeechrc".
# The user settings provided by "~/.multispeechrc"
# always take precedence over the system-wide ones
# from "<sysconfdir>/multispeech.conf". And all these settings in turn
# can be overridden by an extra configuration file specified via the
# command line. Some configuration options are mandatory, so at least
# one of these files must exist.

# The syntax is quite simple.

# Lines started from the "#" character are treated as comments.
# Blank lines are ignored. Each option entry looks like follows:
#
# keyword = value
#
# Case is significant.

# All options are logically grouped by sections.
# Each section is started by its name in square brackets
# on a separate line.


[frontend]
# The frontend options control interactions with client
# when Multispeech is used as Emacspeak speech server.
#
#charset = KOI8-R
# Input charset should be specified by its name. Available names
# can be found in "/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED" or wherever else
# it is on your system. By default this option is not set
# so current locale setting is used.
#
#native_notation = on
dtk_notation = on
# These two options control inline parameters parsing.
# In the default state only native notation is enabled,
# so Multispeech behaves as it used to and accepts only
# special inline commands formed by Emacspeak. When dtk notation
# is enabled, Multispeech recognizes DECtalk inline commands and tries
# to emulate some subset of the DECtalk voice control capabilities.
# Use the word "yes" or "on" to enable and the word
# "no" or "off" to disable the option. Nothing prevents to keep
# both options enabled simultaneously. In this case DECtalk
# inline commands will be accepted as well as the native ones.
# If both options are disabled, then inline commands detection
# and parsing will not be performed at all.

[ssip]
# This section affects Multispeech behaviour as an SSIP server.
#
#port = 6560
# TCP port on which SSIP client connections will be accepted.
#
#sounds = <datadir>/sounds/sound-icons
# Path to the directory where sound icons are stored.
#
#split_multiline_messages = off
# When this option is set, multiline messages sent by command
# "speak" are processed and synthisized line by line, that provides
# more flexibility in the sense of language detection and resuming
# context control, but may cause some additional speech articulation.
# Of course, message itself remains atomic in the protocol terms.
# By default all lines of the multiline message are concatenated
# and processed as one continuous text chunk.

[audio]
# This section contains general audio output control options.
#
#device = 
# Default device for all audio output (speech, sounds and tones).
# If it is not specified explicitly, then system default will be used.
# The DSP device specifications (such as "/dev/dsp")
# are allowed here as well as the ALSA ones.
#
#volume = 0.8
# This value is applied to the audio output in general.
# It should be in the range of (0.0..1.0]. Default value is 0.8.
#
#latency = 0.0
# Audio output latency in seconds. Default value 0.0 implies
# that reasonable latency will be chosen automatically.
# Normally this option should not be set up explicitly.
# Do it only if you are pretty unsatisfied by the automatic choice.

[sounds]
# Sound files playing control options.
#
#device = 
# Sound files playing device. This setting overwrites general default
# and allows to play sound files on a separate audio device.
# The DSP device specifications (such as "/dev/dsp")
# are accepted here as well as the ALSA ones.
#
#volume = 1.0
# Relative volume level for sound files playing. It is 1.0
# by default.
#
#asynchronous = yes
# This option enables or disables to play sound files
# simultaneously with other audio activities, such as
# speech and tone signals producing. It is enabled by default.
# Use the word "yes" or "on" to enable and the word
# "no" or "off" to disable.

[tones]
# This section is devoted to the tone signals producing
# control options.
#
#device = 
# Tones producing device. This setting overwrites general default
# and allows to use a separate device for tone signals.
# The DSP device specifications (such as "/dev/dsp")
# are accepted here as well as the ALSA ones.
#
#volume = 1.0
# Relative volume level for tone signals producing. It is 1.0
# by default.
#
#sampling = 44100
# Sampling frequency for generated tone signals. It is 44100
# by default.
#
#asynchronous = yes
# This option enables or disables to produce tone signals
# simultaneously with other audio activities, such as
# speech and sound files playing. It is enabled by default.
# Use the word "yes" or "on" to enable and the word
# "no" or "off" to disable.

[speech]
# General speech output control options.
#
#device = 
# Speech output device. This setting overwrites general default
# and allows to produce speech on a separate audio device.
# The DSP device specifications (such as "/dev/dsp")
# are accepted here as well as the ALSA ones.
#
#volume = 1.0
# Relative volume level for speech output. It is 1.0 by default.
#
#pitch = 1.0
# Voice pitch adjustment relative to it's normal level.
# It is 1.0 by default. Greater value causes higher pitch.
#
#rate = 1.0
# Relative speech rate for all voices. It is 1.0 by default.
# Higher value causes quicker speech.
#
#char.pitch = 1.0
#char.rate = 1.0
# Relative voice pitch and speech rate control applied to the single
# letters pronunciation. By default 1.0 is suggested.
#
#caps_factor = 1.2
# Voice pitch factor for capital letters. By default it is 1.2
# so capital letters are pronounced by slightly higher pitch.
#
#language = autodetect
# Define speech synthesis language. Allowed values are:
# "en" for English, "ru" for Russian or "autodetect" for automatic
# detection from the text nature. By default language is autodetected.
#
en.engine = freephone
# English TTS engine. This option has no default. If it is not set
# then English speech output will be unavailable in Multispeech.
# Reasonable alternatives are as follows:
# freephone -- English speech with Freephone and Mbrola voice "en1";
# espeak -- English speech with Espeak TTS engine;
# user -- user defined TTS engine.
#
ru.engine = ru_tts
# Russian TTS engine. This option has no default. If it is not set
# then Russian speech output will be unavailable in Multispeech.
# Reasonable alternatives are as follows:
# ru_tts -- Russian speech with Ru_tts speech synthesizer;
# espeak -- Russian speech with Espeak speech synthesizer;
# user -- User defined TTS engine.

# Voice related sections. These sections contain quite the same
# collection of speech control options for each known voice.
# Each section is named by the internal voice name, that is used
# for unambiguous voice identification in the configuration files.

[mbrola]
# Mbrola based backends specific options.
#
#executable = mbrola
# Path to the Mbrola executable. If only program name is specified
# (as it is by default) then environment variable "PATH"
# will be examined and all paths mentioned there will be searched.
#

[user]
# User defined TTS backend options.
#
#command = 
# Shell command to perform TTS transformation. This command
# must accept text on the standard input and produce sound
# stream on the standard output. It should be a simple command,
# pipes or other shell complications are not allowed here,
# but command line arguments may be specified. Moreover, there are
# several special keywords recognized by Multispeech and replaced
# by actual values internally just before execution. This mechanism
# allows Multispeech to pass current speech parameters to the TTS
# engine. These keywords are as follows:
# %lang -- replaced by the language id string;
# %voice -- replaced by conventional voice name;
# %pitch -- replaced by relative voice pitch value;
# %rate -- replaced by relative speech rate value;
# %freq -- replaced by the sampling frequency value.
# The last keyword is replaced only when freq_control is enabled
# (see below).
#
#freq_control = no
# Set this option to "yes" if TTS engine accepts sampling frequency
# specification (as Mbrola does, for instance) and you wish
# to make use of this capability. This option allows "%freq"
# keyword replacement in command line. Leave commented out if unsure.
